# Multimethods, Protocols and Datatypes

## 1 Multimethods

### 1.1 What is a Multimethod

Clojure's `multimethod` system supports runtime polymorphism through dispatching on types, values, attributes and metadata of, and relationships between, one or more arguments. It has a dispachting function defined by `defmulti` macro and one or more `methods` defined by `defmethod` macro.

Multimethod is more flexible than the Java-style single dispatch. Both Clojure protocol and Java use the single dispatch based on the class/type of the first argument. The multimethod allows customized dispatch function based on properties of all arguments and an ad hoc hierarchy.

Additionally, the `remove-method` function removes a method assoicated with a dispatch-value and the `prefer-method` funtion creates an ordering to sovle dispatching ambiguities.

### 1.2 When Should You Use Multimethods

Essentially the `multimethod` solving the `branch-and-call` cases where you need to add code in two places (a branch decision and a callee function) to add a new feature. Simple brach-by-type cases are addressed by protocols while more complicated cases such as dispatch-by-multiple-arguments or ad hoc type or type-derivation can be address by multimethods. Multimethods are very flexible but rare in practice. The easist kind is dispatch-by-class where classes are dynamically defined by a dispatch function. The general rules are:

- If a function branches based on a type or multiple types, consider a multimethod.
- Types do not have to be explicit Java classes or data tag. They can be domain-specific.
- You should be able to interpret the dispatch value of a `defmethod` without having to refere to the `defmulti`.
- Don't use multimethods to handle optinal arguments (simple `nil` case) or recursion.

### 1.3 Value Match and Derivation

Multimethods dispatch is based on derivation and uses `isa?` rather than `=` when testing for dispatch value matches. By default, the hierarchy is globalled defined. Use `make-hierarchy` to create a hierarch object that can be use as a frist argurment of the above functions.

Derivation is determined by a combination of either Java inheritance (for class values), or using Clojureâ€™s ad hoc hierarchy system. The hierarchy system supports derivation relationships between names (either symbols or keywords), and relationships between classes and names. The `derive` function creates these relationships, and the `parents`, `ancestors` and `isa?` functions query the hierarchy.

## 2 Protocols

### 2.1 Motivations

The so-called `expression problem` can be described as providing implementations of new interfaces to old types. Clojure provides `protocol` and reserves `interface` for Java. The motivations behind `protocol` are:

- Provide a high-performance, dynamic polymorphism construct for Clojure.
- Work as host's inteface: specification only (no implementation), a type can implement multiple protocols.
- Avoid interface's drawback: can be extended independently, not an `isa` relationship, no hierarchy.
- Support the 90% case of multimethods because dispatching by type is the most common use case. Each multimethod defines one operation, a protocol can include a set of related operations.

### 2.2 Basics

A protocol is a named set of named methods and their signatures, defined using `defprotocol` and has the following features:

- There are no implementations.
- It consists of one or more methods, where each method can have multiple arities with at least on argument.
- It yields a set of polymorphic functions that dispatch on the type of the first argument, corresponding to the `this` in Java and `self` in Ruby and Python. This is most hosts offer and optimize.
- It is dynamic and doesn't require AOT compilation.
- It creates a host's interface with the same fully qualified name.
- You can implement a protocol on `nil`.
- You are not required to implement all methods. Clojure throws an exception if an unimplemented method is called.

The `deftype`, `defrecord` or `reify` support protocol directly. Use `PascalCase` for protocol and type names because they compiled down to native JVM interfaces and classes.

Use `extend` to extend a type to implement protocols using `protocol + function map` pairs. `extend-type` (one type, multiple protocols) and `extend-protocol` (one protocol, multiple types) are convenience macros. You can extend a Java class to support protocols.

If a protocol ahs `:extend-via-metadata true`, then values can extend the protocol by adding metadata where keys are fully-qualified protocol function symbols and values are function implementations.

Protocol implementations are checked first for direct definitions (`defrecord`, `deftype`, `reify`), then metatdata defintions, then external extensions (`extend`, `extend-type`, `extend-protocol`).

### 2.3 Protocol Introspection

- `extenders`: returns types that have been extended to a given protocol.
- `extends?`: returns true if a type has been extended to a protocol.
- `satisfies?`: returns true if an instance participates in a protocol.

## 3 Datatypes

A Clojure type is a Java class defined by `defrecord` or `deftype`. The type name should be in `PascalCase`. Each argument defines a `public` and `final` field. The default field type is `java.lang.Object`, but you can optinally hint the type of field using metadata. Compared with Clojure map, it has better performance because fields are regular object fields.

Fields defined by `deftype` and `defrecord` can be accessed via a static method `MyType/getBasis`. Other fields can be added later.

`deftype` is intended to define low level types for good performance, whereas `defrecord` are used to reprsent applicaiton-level data that provides read-to-use facilities.

You need to explicitly `import` defined types when use them in a different namespace.

### 3.1 Records

`records`, or `record types`, are defined by `defrecord` that is a macro defined on top of`deftype`. A `record` type has the following facilities:

- value semantics: immutable and structure equality.
- associative collection abstraction: can be treated as a map and can be expanded to have additional fields. Additional fields have the same semantics of map fields.
- metadata support: use `with-meta record` to add meta data.
- reader support: the special syntax `#ns.MyType{:k v ...}`.
- convenience constructor: support for metadata and auxiliary fields
- default factory function: `->MyType` takes positional arguments, `map->MyType` takes a map argument, and `MyType/create` takes a map arugment.

It is often preferable to aproach problems using regular maps first, moving on to records later as circumstances warrant. For example, type-based polymorphism or performance-sensitive field access. Unlike a map, a record is not a function. A map and a record are nver be equal.

### 3.2 Types

`deftype` is used to define low-level data structure or a reference type that supports mutable fields. `deftype` types are not associative and their fields can only be accessed via interop forms.

Mutable fields are defined by `^:volatile-mutable` and `^:unsynchronized-mutable`. They are always private and only accessible from within method bodies provided inline with the type definition.

### 3.3 Implementing Protocols

There are two ways to implement a protocol for any given type: inline or `extend`. Inline implementation have direct access to the type's field and calling protocol methods is as fast as calling an interface method in Java. However, inline implementations are static. When there is a name confict in multiple protocols or with `java.lang.Object` methods, you have to use `extend*` implementation. You can start with `extend*` implementaiton and optimize it if needed.

Inline implementation can be used to implement a Java interface.

Clojure types can only implement protocols or interfaces, there is no concept of hierarchy. Because the `extend` function takes a map as its argument, it is easy to reuse functions.
